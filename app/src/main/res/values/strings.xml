    <string name="whydvorak">Qwerty Keyboards were designed to prevent type writer jamming by making the most commonly used letters farther apart, as old typewriters would often become jammed when pressing adjacent keys rapidly due to the hammer like mechanisms.  \n\n  The Dvorak Keyboard, designed by August Dvorak in 1936 was designed specifically for speed.  It\'s been estimated
    that during an average 8 hour day, a typist\'s fingers will travel 16 miles on a QWERTY keyboard and only 1.6 on a Dvorak keyboard.  Awkward strokes are avoided by having all the most commonly used letters on the home row.</string>
